### Telensa
Working with Kainos Gdansk and Cambridge-based Telensa's [Urban Data Project](https://urbandataproject.org) to deliver the front-end and a design system for the new *City Data Guardian* platform. Built an Angular-based data-visualisation application to demonstrate the business value of environmental data from the platform.
