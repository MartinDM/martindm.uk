<!-- summary -->

Something I often hear and have experienced as the prevailing attitude in teams, particularly from Seniors, is this odd tendency to identify in jest as incompetent.

It’s celebrated very often, but not in what feels like an authentic way; more to caveat one’s contribution with the subtext that our work is ‘sold as seen, no refunds, I’m actually an imposter.’

<!-- /summary -->

I got to thinking about this after The Prime Time’s video on this topic: Seniors, and dev culture at large [_Celebrating Incompetence_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CF9jx2Hhws).

It does a disservice to the realities of being a Senior and the growth we legitimately work toward throughout our career, and that ‘being competent’ (whatever this means) was never the reality, or the destination we should expect. Being ‘Senior’ will not imbue us with complete mastery.

A software engineering career is characterised by an endless pursuit of incrementally becoming less-wrong; the journey is not supposed to culminate in knowing everything intuitively or even feeling like we have accounted for everything and have reached certainty. To think in this way is more the mark of the _expert beginner_ who might believe in this destination at all.

We must then, to even allow ourselves to make an impact and fulfill our responsibility to other developers, identify with and _embody our competence_.

At some point, we have been entrusted with the Senior title; done the hardest parts; translating semantics into syntax, technical fundamentals, and switched focus to whole-team health, enablement, and developed commercial and technical communication.

So, are we about to claim incompetence because we still need to rely on Stack Overflow for looking up minutiae of what we know we need to implement?

This is not a failing; it’s how we reserve space for things that matter when complexity compounds and the priority for what needs to be held is at a premium.

The feeling of not knowing everything is just part of the journey we signed up for, rather than being some personal shortcoming and it’s not helpful to promote an expectation of lifelong incompetence to newer developers. They _will_ reach competence soon and be similarly impactful; able to be confident in their solutions, recommendations and communication at a higher level.

Indeed it’s necessary as an effective, professional developer to trust oneself to make bold, impactful decisions and communicate confidently to other devs and have wider influence on behalf of engineering in the business.

We’ve worked on customer-facing and business-critical software, paid the table-stakes.

We _know_ what we are doing insofar as the role allows, and we should identify as empowered developers to those looking to us for inspiration and empowerment in _their_ early career.

So let’s ditch this damaging ‘I don’t know what I’m doing’ identification and the disempowerment it promotes, and step into our responsibility as Developers to realise our experience and skills so far, and simply work with humility, open to new learning, inevitable mistakes and feedback, and confidently make the impact we are best able to do, such that we inspire others to do the same.
