  üë®‚Äçüíª More Than Builders: Redefining Engineering Impact with AI
---

<!-- summary -->

**How developers can stay relevant, lead with impact, and shape the future beyond code.**

Let‚Äôs say at this point, I don‚Äôt buy-into AI replacing developers; at least for the forseable, and in our current form; rather we‚Äôre at the start of what I feel is an imperative for evolution of the Software Engineering discipline in a Product team.

<!-- /summary -->

A need to shift in _where_ the engineers most valuable competence lies; the skills we‚Äôll need to be most impactful in orgs in a post-AI world, where code generation is _not_ uniquely our superpower. or means of self-expression.

The conversation around what the adoption of LLMs seems to shift every week, and we can only speculate where AI generation of rudimentary apps will be in the medium term, it‚Äôs clearly not going away and is forcing us to confront truths about what this means for developers, and orgs to make best use of their hard-learned technical insight.

Engineering craft and coding ability were once differentiators; something organisations covet. But as our IC efficiency increases, getting from 0 to 60 on new ideas faster, I believe it‚Äôs technical leadership, system-level clarity, and literacy in product strategy that will define an engineer‚Äôs impact in the post-AI organisation.

Engineering skill has found its higher purpose. To become a new type of high-agency operator at any seniority.

‚ÄòBeing an introvert‚Äô, the often cited reason developers ‚Äòjust want to code‚Äô is not even antithetical to building these skills. ‚ÄòIntroversion‚Äô, itself a potential superpower should not preclude us from _caring deeply,_ engaging with humility and in my experience, some _bravery_ in advocating for a culture of improvement; for our teams and users.

Whether you decide to step up or not, developing these skills is going to become _the_ sustainable strategy for advancing as Engineers in an AI era.

**Devs; Product leaders**

With increased leverage and efficiency, we may start to see this shift to Product-Engineering reflected in team structures and accountabilities.

Product Engineers aren‚Äôt just builders; more strategic operators with a strong grasp of product-market fit, user experience, as well as system design.

Now less focused on code generation alone, we can act as advisors and user advocates, identifying _what_ are valuable bets in the first place, creating that vision, and describing what a maintainable, technically robust _product solution_ looks like to stakeholders.

Companies will look for ambitious, empathetic developers for their _product skills. Perhaps fewer,_ but with increased autonomy and accountability among Product leaders.

Consequently, I feel organisations will become naturally compelled to revise outdated, learned org boundaries, guarded power structures and risk averse process, as the cost of _iteration_ continues to drop while ability to ship means opportunity cost of delay rises.

In return, organisations can build close Product-Engineering collaboration, strong tech culture, direct connection to users and a culture that normalises personal investment in building something truly great and all the downstream benefits that come with that.

_Shipping_ is what realises value from our code, and from all the ceremony around it.

It‚Äôs where we get to see _which_ of our bets paid off, and get the prize: The user feedback, to go again.

Some product organisations are not yet awoken to the opportunity of working in this way, instead making an expensive trade off between attempts at certainty a layered and hand-offs, and shipping quickly; optimising for the former, while newcomers might more easily optimise for the latter.

And not just because of AI. It always made sense.

AI will just accelerate this shift, to re-imagine what it means to be a Software Engineer and the impact available to us and competitive benefit to organisations.

I feel this will continue as engineers can do more with less, iterate quickly, and step into Product-leadership on higher-order discovery and design challenges unique suited to humans.
