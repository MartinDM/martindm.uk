<!-- summary -->

September has arrived already, and I was sure to allow myself a day-off; some downtime I set aside for myself in anticipation of a need for extra space for myself as we move into autumn. Over the years, Iâ€™ve learned to prepare for the darkening evenings by taking steps to ensure I can thrive through the autumn and winter with purpose and a positive mindset; creatively and emotionally.

I'm reflecting more on understanding _what are the things I need_. These are not obvious and take some introspection to identify.

I decided to book a couple of days off as a way to check in with myself and shore up against stressors I may encounter so I can continue to meet them with bravery and a grounding in myself; my confidece and agency.

For now though, and due to being dilligent and self-aware, I planned the day to be bright and enjoyable.

I took a day to wander and think; to plan some activities and work on my goals.
