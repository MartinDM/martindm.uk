### Reading üìö

Really in to audiobooks this year, but also redescovering the tactile reading experience of print:

- [Entangled Life üçÑ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Entangled-Life-Worlds-Change-Futures/dp/1784708275/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.P7Bl9t2nBvcuFWxhNWmR9plJRsPKu-YkFyjDLgwGd5YyFvDgbZx3nf_CEWzVjMNUk2a8veH6wQznLQWRFfPs-3r34ECE0BNhA91rCLO0HEjE2zTOR1urkm1VnUeEbOjbHBbIo10O4ezZenauoa9_TFa4A45e7xxFQzhf04YpEoge8ypHsX7ho4qx6fcsbyFp8c-PbG9sMWXfB8DjOLkxCTKbvw5jaCdz5Xr3leYp4HY.PsJFTBYlPqA7sgrst2vgQM0IVounK0a3ijZ9xir8f9s&qid=1716152055&sr=8-1)

Loved these classics which I frequently return to:

- [Atomic Habits üç¨](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1572385941&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySVZFWENFUzgySU1PJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzk0NTE0MUdDQ05GNFBCOU5LRSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzQyODU4MUZSSzJHT0EwRFhNRSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=), James Clear

- [Deep Work üß†](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/0349411905/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=deep+work&qid=1572385887&sr=8-1), Cal Newport

### Thinking about

- Being deliberate with how I spend time. Having systematically cutting out much 'low value' time sinks and unplugging from social media, there is much time available. I need to be deliberate with using it to foster meaningful relationships and towards fulfilling things like developing my art skills and reflection on my goals and values

- Writing more about my experience at work, creativity and reflections on myself

- Really challenging my belief that just because I love what I do, I don't need to allow space around it to experience life

- Giving myself credit and valuing my unique skills; not comparing myself harshly with others who have different skills and sensibilities

Thanks for taking an interest!
