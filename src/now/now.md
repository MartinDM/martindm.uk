### Reading 📚

Really in to audiobooks this year, but also redescovering the tactile reading experience of print:

Loved these from earlier this/last year too!

- [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1572385941&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySVZFWENFUzgySU1PJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzk0NTE0MUdDQ05GNFBCOU5LRSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzQyODU4MUZSSzJHT0EwRFhNRSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=), James Clear

### Thinking about

- Being deliberate with how I spend time. Having systematically cutting out much 'low value' time sinks/media, there is much time available. I need to be deliberate with using it to foster meaningful relationships and towards fulfilling things!
- Writing more about my experience at work and ideas (learning, value, growth, future of our work on the web)
- Really challenging my belief that just because I love what I do, I don't need to allow space around it.
- Giving myself credit and valuing my unique skills; not comparing myself harshly with others

Thanks for taking an interest!
