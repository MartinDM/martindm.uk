Day-to-day: Senior Front-end Engineer at Vodafone 🙋‍♂️

### Local Tech Events

Attended [Notts Agile](https://www.meetup.com/NottAgile/) this month where we learned about building effective teams and healthy, safe development cultures. [Tweet >](https://twitter.com/MartinoNotts/status/1187136543833636865)
Quite a few references and ideas from this meetup around team culture:

- [Atlassian Rules of Engagement](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/rules-of-engagement)
- Understand how to interact with others by understanding personality types: [Speak First Animal Quiz](https://www.speak-first.com/which-animal-are-you/) (I'm mostly Owl).
- [Understand your resilience](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/resilience-quiz.htm)

### Health & fitness

Recently recovered from a knee injury which kept me off running for what felt like an age! I did discover road riding in the meantime - the [road bike](https://www.instagram.com/p/B089DcdllOtNO7r7JsU7I3kSemzxmgSqQimrD00/) became my new favourite thing! Getting back on the running again now though! 🚀

### Thinking about

- Being deliberate with how I spend time. Having systematically cutting out much 'low value' time sinks/media, there is much time available. I need to be deliberate with using it to foster meaningful relationships and towards fulfilling things!
- Writing more about my experience at work and ideas (learning, value, growth, future of our work on the web)
- Really challenging my belief that just because I love what I do, I don't need to allow space around it.
- Giving myself credit and valuing my unique skills; not comparing myself harshly with others

Thanks for taking an interest!
