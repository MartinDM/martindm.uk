### Thinking about

- Trusting in myself and my experience, and being brave enough to step up to the challenges I see around me. I'm developing my ambition, bravery and resilience to feel empowered in myself to to pursue what I want to.

If there is no passion and personal investment given to something in a company, mediocrity prevails.

Inertia is all around us, and few will step up to the challenge of right action at personal risk, but that is not an exciting, impactfulway to live. I go to work to have impact and improve things; the product, our daily work, our mission. But there is heavy inertia.

I have come to understand lack of passion and personal investmenr is the failure mode; the pull of mediocrity organisations default to without empassioned, humble leadership.

- Develop a reputation for consistency; good or bad. Just always predictable in my responses and actions, to build trust and clear communication.

- Being deliberate with how I spend time. Having systematically cutting out much 'low value' time sinks and unplugging from social media, there is much time available. I need to be deliberate with using it to foster meaningful relationships and towards fulfilling things like developing my art skills and reflection on my goals and values

- Giving myself credit and valuing my unique skills; not comparing myself harshly with others who have different skills and sensibilities

- Challenging myself to draw more, even if it's rubbish, and share it on my drawing instagram [martino_draws](https://instagram.com/martino_draws)
