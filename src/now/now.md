### Thinking about

- Trusting in myself and my experience, and step up to the challenges I see around me. I'm developing a sense of feeling worthy of expressing myself and having experience which serves me well to feel confident to lead others.

This is not to assume anything I know is perfect information, but it's more important to _just do_, gather feedback and refine. As long as there's humility, respect, flexibility, we are each able to lead those around us.

## In work

- How I can help my team to implement some of the ideas from Accelerate, challenge established thinking and working which no longer serve us in our journey toward CI/CD and high performance. Ai is changing what we can and need to do, such that organisational boudnaries are quickly becoming obsolte. We are not ready for this as an economy.

- I want to coach us to be brave enough to realise the benefits of optimising for feedback; reducing hand offs, and latency introduced with long-live branches, isolating us from the current state of the system.

- If there is no passion and personal investment from individuals in a team, mediocrity grows and is allowed to prevail, and infects the culture.

- As a [HSP](https://www.verywellmind.com/highly-sensitive-persons-traits-that-create-more-stress-4126393), I want to develop a reputation for consistency—not necessarily always agreeable, but predictably thoughtful, direct, and steady in how I respond and act. As a highly sensitive person, I’m acutely aware of shifts in tone, subtext, and glimpses into real emotion. These variations can cloud collaboration or introduce second-guessing in communication to me. By minimising variability in my _own_ tone and responses, I remove ambiguity ain my own responses to encourage someone to be open and straight-forward with me as well, trusting my own response as sincere and consistently honest.

- Being deliberate with how I spend time. Having systematically cutting out much 'low value' time sinks and unplugging from social media, there is much time available. I need to be deliberate with using it to foster meaningful relationships and towards fulfilling things like developing my art skills and reflection on my goals and values

- Challenging myself to draw more, even if it's rubbish, and share it on my drawing instagram [martino_draws](https://instagram.com/martino_draws)
