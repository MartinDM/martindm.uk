I was playing recently with the album and artist info available via the Apple iTunes database using their API, so thought it would be a fun idea to turn it into an app.

I started with some Figma wireframes and a spec I'd set for myself such as the entity type and sizes I wanted to make available.

Built with React and Vite with Chakra UI components.

This was a fun coding exercise to add hardware items to a list with some business rules I set myself, such as implementing unique IDs per asset, and an undo function.

The state of the list also persists between refresh using local storage.
