I recently made myself some posters of my favourite albums and needed some high quality album art to use for my designs...

I was able to get them via the Apple iTunes database using their API, so thought it would be a fun idea to turn it into an app.

I imagined if I had a need for searchable album artwork for creative projects, surely others might!

I started with some Figma wireframes and a spec I'd set for myself such as the entity type and sizes I wanted to make available.

Built with React and Vite with Chakra UI components.

This was a fun coding exercise to add hardware items to a list with some business rules I set myself, such as implementing unique IDs per asset, and an undo function.

The state of the list also persists between refresh using local storage.
